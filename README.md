## Assignment Overview
This is an introductory Java assignmnet designed to help us get used to IntelliJ, Checkstyle, and cloning pre-existing
code from GitHub. StarterApplication 

## Technical Impression:
[Describe what you have done to complete the assignment in 200-500 words.
The word count is not strict, so don't worry about going slightly over;
however, summaries that do not meet the minimum length requirement or
are trivial in nature (representing little thought or effort) will not
get full credit. You can share your personal experiences, things that
particularly frustrated you about the assignment, things that particularly
interested you about the assignment, etc. It is especially important that
you document any difficulties you had with tools, Java libraries, etc.]

## Unresolved problems in my submission:
None

## Citations and Collaborations:
I asked the class discord for help with getting the unit tests to work, 
however we covered that in class.

## Questions:
None
